# Web-TodoList

* Learned to use Gradient
* User can sort the Activities as All, completed and uncompleted.
* User can delete any activity. (There is an animation for that)
* All the Activites are saved in local storage. Even if the Page gets reloaded all the progress is being saved.
* The deleted activites get deleted from the storage also.
